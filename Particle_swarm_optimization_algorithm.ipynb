        "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization technique developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995. The 2007 work by Poli, Kennedy, and Blackwell provides a more formalized description of the PSO algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Kennedy and Eberhart (1995) vs Poli, Kennedy and Blackwell (2007)\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea of both versions remains the sameâ€”particles \"fly\" through the solution space by updating their positions and velocities over time, influenced by their own best-known positions and the best-known positions of their neighbors or the swarm as a whole. However, there are some notable differences in the way they are presented.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Initialization\n",
        "Both versions suggest initializing the particle swarm by setting initial positions and velocities randomly. This is a common approach, as it helps to search a wide range of the solution space initially.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Fitness Calculation\n",
        "Both the 1995 and 2007 versions emphasize calculating a fitness value for each particle based on the objective function to be minimized or maximized. Based on this fitness value, the algorithm updates the personal best and the global best values for the swarm.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Update Rules\n",
        "Both versions specify that particles update their velocity and position based on personal and global best positions. However, the 2007 version provides a more formalized mathematical representation for updating the velocity:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[ v = v + c1 \\times \\text{rand}() \\times (pbest - x) + c2 \\times \\text{rand}() \\times (gbest - x) \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, \\( c1 \\) and \\( c2 \\) are acceleration coefficients, \\(\\text{rand}()\\), is a random number between 0 and 1, \\( pbest \\) is the personal best position, \\( gbest \\) is the global best position, \\( x \\) is the current position, and \\( v \\) is the velocity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Stopping Criteria\n",
        "Both versions suggest that the algorithm should continue iterating until either a maximum number of iterations is reached or some minimum error criteria is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "Overall, while the essence of the algorithm hasn't changed, the 2007 version by Poli, Kennedy, and Blackwell provides a more rigorous and formal description of PSO. It's often beneficial to refer to both versions for a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithm."
